    "## Python Variables Are Pointers\n",
    "\n",
    "Assigning variables in Python is as easy as putting a variable name to the left of the equals (``=``) sign:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# assign 4 to the variable x\n",
    "x = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This may seem straightforward, but if you have the wrong mental model of what this operation does, the way Python works may seem confusing.\n",
    "We'll briefly dig into that here.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many programming languages, variables are best thought of as containers or buckets into which you put data.\n",
    "So in C, for example, when you write\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "// C code\n",
    "int x = 4;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you are essentially defining a \"memory bucket\" named ``x``, and putting the value ``4`` into it.\n",
    "In Python, by contrast, variables are best thought of not as containers but as pointers.\n",
    "So in Python, when you write\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "you are essentially defining a *pointer* named ``x`` that points to some other bucket containing the value ``4``.\n",
    "Note one consequence of this: because Python variables just point to various objects, there is no need to \"declare\" the variable, or even require the variable to always point to information of the same type!\n",
    "This is the sense in which people say Python is *dynamically-typed*: variable names can point to objects of any type.\n",
